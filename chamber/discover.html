            <h1>Visit Montevideo</h1>
            <div class="sidebar"><div><p>Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is a major city along the Montevideo Bay. It revolves around Plaza de la Independencia, once home to a Spanish citadel. This square leads to the Ciudad Vieja (the old town), with art deco buildings, colonial houses, and sights such as the imposing Palacio Salvo and the neoclassical theater Sol√≠s. The Mercado del Puerto is an old port market filled with many steakhouses. <br>
            In this wonderful city you can enjoy various activities. From shopping trips, visits to museums, visits to libraries and restaurants, as well as more extreme activities such as surfing on its beautiful beaches, beach volleyball, etc.

                <div class="rambla"><picture><img src="iamges/montevideo-rambla-large.webp" alt="rambla img" loading="lazy"></picture><div><h2>Montevideo Coast</h2>
                <p>The Rambla of Montevideo is an avenue that goes all along the coastline of Montevideo, Uruguay. At a length of over 22.2 uninterrupted kilometres (13.7 mi), the promenade runs along the R√≠o de la Plata and continues down the entire coast of Montevideo. Since all the southern departments of Uruguay are against either the R√≠o de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. The Rambla is an integral part of Montevidean identity and has been proposed as a World Heritage site. <br>

                    La Rambla, South of the Bay of Montevideo, is an environment for a wide variety of outdoor activities such as jogging, walking, biking, fishing, kite-flying, sunbathing and drinking mate. Skateboarding and roller skating are also possible in special areas for these activities. The avenue is secured by the Tourism Police Unit during the summer to keep a safe environment for tourists.

                <div class="playamvd"><picture><img src="iamges/playa-montevideo.webp" alt="playa img" loading="lazy"></picture><div><h2>Montevideo Beach</h2>
                    <p>During the summer period, the beaches are the main attraction both for the population of Montevideo and for tourists who visit the city, so the use of its waters for recreation is of vital importance. <br>
                        Montevideo's beaches are characterized by their white sands and clean waters, perfect for bathing.
    
                        Most of the city's beaches have the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Certification, which makes Montevideo the first capital in the world to have certified the management of these spaces, ensuring their enjoyment by citizens. <br>
    
                        In addition to the lifeguard service, all authorized beaches have guaranteed health coverage and care for bathers through first aid posts and urgent and emergency medical care.
